Answer: 
The classifier did choose the same/correct breed of the image of the dog_01.jpg in all three architectures. 


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Yes each architecture classified dog_01.jpg and dog_02.jpg as the same breed correctly

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: 
Yes


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
All architecutres got the same correct result. I believe the "Alexnet" is the best arcitecture for classifying these images because it was the fastest to process the images and return a result with a "Total Elapsed Runtime" of  0:0:1.0 The others were 5 seconds and 9 seconds in total.
